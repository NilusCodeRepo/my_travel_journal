        desc: "The capital city of Netherlands probably has one of the most chilled out vibes across all cities of Europe. If you're travelling to Amsterdam, rest assured, it's going to be one of your most wonderful experiences. The city has everything, from a bustling nightlife, to picnic parks, to some spectacular museums. You're going to find yourself spoilt for choice! Ditch everything and rent a bike, have a picnic in the Vondelpark, go shopping in the streets of Jordaan, cruise in Amsterdam's picturesque canals, eat popular street foods such as the herring at the herring carts, visit the historical house of Anne Frank, or go beer tasting at de Goyer's Brouwerij 'Tij (and the tons of microbreweries on offer throughout the city)."

        desc:"\"Welcome to the fantasy of a dreamy island with utmost perfectional beauty\"- This is how the pictures of Bora Bora entice you for a vacation. A part of French Polynesia, this magical island has some of the most beautiful sights to behold- a tropical island surrounded by the amazing blue lagoon and coral reefs, accompanied by small islets (Motus) scattered around Bora Bora. Bora Bora has a lot more to offer apart from its indulging over-water and beach-side resorts. When you get slightly bored of sunbathing and your supercool tan starts looking like burnt skins, you can always turn to some great adventures for an extraordinary experience. There are a couple of underwater activities that also allow you to interact with the enigmatic marine life."

        desc:"One of the most recently discovered ruins, the Incan ruins of Machu Picchu continue to astound historians, archaeologists and historical enthusiasts alike. A mystery of its real purpose surrounds the place and historians till date continue to debate on the matter. A hotspot within the ruins itself, The Temple of the Sun is known for having windows perfectly positioned to let the rays of the sun inside in intricate patterns. Apart from the archaeological site itself, the panoramic view of the Huayna Picchu peak is a breathtaking sight you can never forget. Adventure seekers can also trek along the beautiful Inca trails which offer the most honest experience of Peru's Incan heritage. Machu Picchu is packed throughout the year, but once you experience it yourself, you cannot help but want to keep going back for more."
